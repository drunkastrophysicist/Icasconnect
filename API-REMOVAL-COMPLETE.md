# ALL APIs REMOVED ❌

## What Was Completely Removed:

### 🔴 Real API Connections:
- ❌ `https://api.icasconnect.online/v1` - Base URL removed
- ❌ All `fetch()` calls to external servers
- ❌ Network error handling for real APIs
- ❌ Authorization headers to real backend
- ❌ Real file upload functionality
- ❌ Any external HTTP requests

### 🔴 Functions Converted to Offline-Only:
- ❌ `login()` - No real authentication
- ❌ `register()` - No real user creation  
- ❌ `getEvents()` - No real event fetching
- ❌ `uploadFile()` - No real file uploads
- ❌ `createResource()` - No real resource creation
- ❌ All CRUD operations for users, courses, schedules, etc.

### 🔴 Network Dependencies:
- ❌ Internet connection no longer needed
- ❌ External server dependencies removed
- ❌ API authentication tokens (still stored but not used)

## What Your App Now Does:

### ✅ 100% Offline Operation:
- ✅ Mock login with fake users (`john@example.com`, `jane@teacher.com`, etc.)
- ✅ Mock data for all resources, events, courses
- ✅ Simulated network delays for realistic feel
- ✅ All UI components work exactly the same
- ✅ File uploads work with fake file objects
- ✅ Full CRUD operations on mock data

### ✅ Zero External Dependencies:
- ✅ No internet required
- ✅ No backend server needed
- ✅ No API keys or authentication
- ✅ Completely self-contained

## Status:
🔴 **OFFLINE MODE ACTIVE**  
🚀 **Your app runs 100% independently**  
📱 **All features work with mock data**  
⚡ **Instant loading - no network delays**

Your app is now completely disconnected from all external APIs and works purely with local mock data!
